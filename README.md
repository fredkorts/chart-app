# Chart App

## Project Overview

This project is a React + TypeScript task management dashboard that allows users to easily plan, visualize, and manage their work on a quarterly timeline. The application provides a clear, interactive chart where tasks are displayed as horizontal bars, making it simple to see schedules, overlaps, and deadlines at a glance.

## Core Features

**Add New Tasks** – Users can create tasks with a name, start date, and end date. Input validation ensures correct formatting (DD.MM.YYYY) and logical date ranges.

**Interactive Timeline** – Tasks are shown on a responsive timeline with unique colors for quick identification. Users can view by quarter, with partial bars displayed for tasks that span multiple periods.

**Quarter Navigation** – Simple arrow controls allow switching between previous and next quarters, updating the chart and visible tasks accordingly.

**Task Details** – Clicking on a task opens a modal with detailed information.

**Responsive Design** – Optimized for both desktop and mobile. On smaller screens, form fields stack vertically and the timeline scrolls horizontally for easy access.

## User Experience

The app is designed to feel like:

- A visual calendar for projects
- A simple task tracker
- A timeline tool for scheduling and planning

## Benefits

**Quick Overview** – See what's happening this quarter at a glance.

**Easy Planning** – Identify available time slots for new work.

**Visual Clarity** – Instantly spot overlapping or extended tasks.

**Lightweight Management** – Add and track tasks in seconds.

## Example Use Cases

**Project Managers** can outline milestones per quarter, review progress in meetings, and prepare for upcoming phases.

**Freelancers** can track multiple client projects, distinguish them by color, and evaluate availability before taking on new work.
