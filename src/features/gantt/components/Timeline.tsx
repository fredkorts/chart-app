/**
 * Timeline Component
 * 
 * A comprehensive timeline visualization component that serves as the main content area
 * for the Gantt chart. This component manages the grid, time scale, and coordinates
 * the positioning of multiple TaskBar components within the timeline view.
 * 
 * Core Responsibilities:
 * - Render the timeline grid with month/week/day divisions
 * - Manage the coordinate system for task positioning
 * - Handle timeline-level interactions (zoom, pan, selection)
 * - Coordinate multiple TaskBar components and their overlapping logic
 * - Provide scrollable viewport for large datasets
 * 
 * Visual Structure:
 * - Time scale header showing months, weeks, and optionally days
 * - Grid lines for visual reference (monthly, weekly divisions)
 * - Background zebra striping for row separation
 * - Scrollable content area with fixed headers
 * - Today indicator line (vertical line showing current date)
 * - Working hours/days highlighting (future enhancement)
 * 
 * Props Interface (planned):
 * - timelineData: TimelineData - Current quarter/period information
 * - tasks: TaskBarData[] - Processed tasks with positioning
 * - rowHeight: number - Height of each task row
 * - showWeekends?: boolean - Whether to highlight weekends
 * - showToday?: boolean - Whether to show today indicator
 * - onTimelineClick?: (date: Date) => void - Click on empty timeline
 * - onTasksChange?: (tasks: Task[]) => void - For drag-drop operations
 * - className?: string - Additional CSS classes
 * 
 * Grid System:
 * - Monthly columns as primary divisions (3 months per quarter)
 * - Weekly subdivisions for detailed planning
 * - Daily granularity for precise positioning
 * - Responsive grid that adapts to container width
 * - Configurable time scale (quarter/month/week views)
 * 
 * Coordinate Calculations:
 * - Convert dates to pixel positions within timeline
 * - Handle different time scales and zoom levels
 * - Manage task overlap detection and row assignment
 * - Calculate optimal spacing for readability
 * - Support for different calendar systems (future)
 * 
 * Interaction Features:
 * - Horizontal scrolling for longer time periods
 * - Timeline zoom (quarter/month/week/day views)
 * - Drag and drop for task rescheduling (future)
 * - Multi-select with click + drag (future)
 * - Timeline range selection (future)
 * - Context menu for timeline operations (future)
 * 
 * Performance Optimizations:
 * - Virtual scrolling for large numbers of tasks
 * - Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
 * - Debounced resize handling
 * - Optimized grid rendering with CSS transforms
 * - Lazy loading of off-screen content
 * 
 * Responsive Design:
 * - Mobile-friendly touch interactions
 * - Adaptive grid density based on screen size
 * - Collapsible details for smaller screens
 * - Horizontal scroll optimization for mobile
 * - Pinch-to-zoom support (future)
 * 
 * Accessibility Features:
 * - Keyboard navigation through timeline
 * - Screen reader support for time divisions
 * - High contrast mode compatibility
 * - Focus management for complex interactions
 * - ARIA landmarks for timeline sections
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Works with TaskBar components for task rendering
 * - Uses TimelineData interface from GanttChart
 * - Integrates with date utilities for calculations
 * - Compatible with existing task management system
 * - Supports Estonian localization for time labels
 * 
 * Future Enhancements:
 * - Multiple timeline views (resources, projects, teams)
 * - Gantt dependencies with connecting lines
 * - Milestone markers and indicators
 * - Critical path highlighting
 * - Timeline annotations and comments
 * - Export capabilities (PDF, PNG)
