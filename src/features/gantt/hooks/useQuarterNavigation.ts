/**
 * useQuarterNavigation Hook
 * 
 * A custom React hook that manages quarter-based navigation state and logic for
 * Gantt charts and other timeline components. This hook encapsulates all the
 * logic for moving between quarters, handling year transitions, and providing
 * navigation utilities.
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Centralize quarter navigation logic for reuse across components
 * - Handle complex year transitions (Q4 2024 -> Q1 2025)
 * - Provide consistent navigation behavior throughout the application
 * - Enable URL synchronization and bookmarking of specific quarters
 * - Support keyboard and programmatic navigation
 * 
 * Input Parameters:
 * - initialYear?: number - Starting year (defaults to current year)
 * - initialQuarter?: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 - Starting quarter (defaults to current quarter)
 * - onNavigate?: (year: number, quarter: number) => void - Optional callback
 * - bounds?: { minYear: number, maxYear: number } - Navigation limits
 * 
 * Return Value:
 * - currentYear: number - Current selected year
 * - currentQuarter: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 - Current selected quarter
 * - goToPrevious: () => void - Navigate to previous quarter
 * - goToNext: () => void - Navigate to next quarter
 * - goToQuarter: (year: number, quarter: number) => void - Jump to specific quarter
 * - goToToday: () => void - Navigate to current quarter
 * - canGoBack: boolean - Whether previous navigation is available
 * - canGoForward: boolean - Whether next navigation is available
 * - quarterInfo: QuarterInfo - Detailed information about current quarter
 * 
 * Core Navigation Logic:
 * 
 * 1. Previous Quarter Navigation:
 *    - Q1 -> Previous year Q4
 *    - Q2 -> Same year Q1
 *    - Q3 -> Same year Q2
 *    - Q4 -> Same year Q3
 *    - Respects minimum year bounds
 * 
 * 2. Next Quarter Navigation:
 *    - Q4 -> Next year Q1
 *    - Q1 -> Same year Q2
 *    - Q2 -> Same year Q3
 *    - Q3 -> Same year Q4
 *    - Respects maximum year bounds
 * 
 * 3. Direct Navigation:
 *    - Validates year and quarter ranges
 *    - Handles edge cases and invalid inputs
 *    - Provides smooth transitions
 * 
 * State Management:
 * - Uses useState for current year and quarter
 * - Maintains navigation history for back/forward functionality
 * - Synchronizes with external state when provided
 * - Persists navigation state in localStorage (optional)
 * 
 * Quarter Information:
 * - Start and end dates for current quarter
 * - Month names in Estonian localization
 * - Days in quarter calculation
 * - Relative position within year
 * - Formatted display strings
 * 
 * Keyboard Navigation:
 * - Left/Right arrow keys for previous/next quarter
 * - Home/End for first/last quarter of year
 * - Page Up/Down for previous/next year
 * - Support for custom key bindings
 * 
 * URL Integration (Future):
 * - Sync navigation state with URL parameters
 * - Enable bookmarking of specific quarters
 * - Browser back/forward button support
 * - Deep linking to specific time periods
 * 
 * Validation & Bounds:
 * - Enforce minimum and maximum year limits
 * - Validate quarter values (1-4 only)
 * - Handle invalid date transitions gracefully
 * - Provide error feedback for invalid operations
 * 
 * Performance Considerations:
 * - Memoized calculations for quarter information
 * - Efficient date calculations using existing utilities
 * - Minimal re-renders through useCallback for handlers
 * - Debounced rapid navigation attempts
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Uses Quarter type from types/index.ts
 * - Leverages date utilities from utils/dateUtils.ts
 * - Compatible with existing quarter formatting functions
 * - Works with Estonian localization patterns
 * - Integrates with existing navigation components
 * 
 * Accessibility Features:
 * - Screen reader announcements for navigation changes
 * - ARIA live regions for current quarter updates
 * - Keyboard navigation support
 * - Focus management during navigation
 * - High contrast mode compatibility
 * 
 * Usage Examples:
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic usage
 * const { currentYear, currentQuarter, goToNext, goToPrevious } = useQuarterNavigation();
 * 
 * // With bounds and callback
 * const navigation = useQuarterNavigation(2023, 1, {
 *   onNavigate: (year, quarter) => console.log(`Navigated to Q${quarter} ${year}`),
 *   bounds: { minYear: 2020, maxYear: 2030 }
 * });
 * 
 * // Jump to specific quarter
 * navigation.goToQuarter(2024, 3);
 * 
 * // Go to current quarter
 * navigation.goToToday();
 * ```
 * 
 * Future Enhancements:
 * - Navigation animations and transitions
 * - Quarter range selection (Q1-Q3 2024)
 * - Fiscal year support (different year start months)
 * - Custom period definitions beyond quarters
 * - Integration with calendar picker components
 * - Bulk navigation operations
